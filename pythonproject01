# pythonproject-01
I've started developing my own projects after learning the fundamentals of Python. This is my first project, which is called the Law Quiz. A computer will ask you a few legal questions, and at the end of the project, you can view your score. 
print("Holaaa Aum , I am LAW-AI,your law assiatant\n")
lawquiz= input("NIVAN: Do you want to play a law quiz aum?\n")
if lawquiz != "yes":
   quit()
print("LAW-AI: Okay,lets play :)\n") 
score=0
answer = input("LAW-AI: Who is the Legal Advisor to the Government of a State in India?\n")
if answer == "the advocate general":
       print('correct ans bruhhhhh , going hard my man\n')
       score +=1
else:
  print("incorrect bruh , the ans is the advocate general\n")
  
answer= input("LAW-AI :The age of retirement of a Judge of a High Court in India is\n")
if answer == "62":
  print("correct ans bruhhhhh , going hard my man\n")
  score+=1
else:
  print("incorrect bruh, the ans is 62 , think hard bruh\n")

answer = input("LAW-AI :What is the total number of High Courts in India?")
if answer == "25":
  print("correct ans bruhhhhh , going hard my man\n ")
  score+=1
else:
  print("incorrect bruh, the ans is 25 , think hard bruh\n")
answer = input("LAW-AI: Sharda Act deals with\n")  
if answer== "child marriage":
  print("correct ans bruhhhhh , going hard my man\n")
  score+=1

  print("incorrect bruh, the ans is child marriage , think hard bruh\n")

answer = input("LAW-AI :Who was the first Minister of Law of independent India?\n")

  print("incorrect bruh, the ans is dr br ambedkar , think hard bruh\n")

print(f"Aum you got {score} questions correct")
print(f"Aum  you got {score/5*100} %")
